# budget-tracker
## Description
In this budget tracker application users are able to add a deposit and an expense to the tracker. The tracker will automatically update the total balance of the account when the budget is updated. This application is usable offline as well where users can still add a deposit/expense and the budget will update, which is a really helpful feature. Once connection is regained, the budget updates continue as the application comes back online. This application utilizes MongoDB for the database and Express.js for the server. Service Worker and IndexedDB are also being used to add the offline functionality to the application.
